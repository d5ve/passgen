=head1 NAME

passgen - generate secure-ish passwords

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This perl script generates passwords/passphrases from my chosen template. This
template is for three short words to be concatenated together. The first word
is all lowercase, the second word is ALL UPPERCASE, and the third word uses the
standard 'replace vowels with numbers' leetspeek transform.

For example:

This is security through obscurity, as if an attacker knows the template, then
they can easily craft a password cracker to suit.

I use these passwords for signing up on various websites, and want to balance
the ease of remembering these passwords against their worst-case crackability.

Three-word passwords at least have a length of 12 characters or more, and won't
fall to the simplest dictionary attacks.

Don't use these passwords for anything important.

This script hasn't been audited by anyone who knows anything about password
security.
